Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe.

Ask the waiter for extra butter for the baked potato and by the time the butter came the potato was so cold, even the half melted butter wouldn't even melt the rest of the way. Took ten minutes to flag down our server for more soda since he never came back to check on us. Husband got the short ribs which was three pieces of meat. Ate one and started to eat the next but the remaining pieces were just fat and gristle. Complained to the server and was told the dinner would be taken off our bill but we had to pay for the sides. So how exactly did the \"sides\" almost cost as much as the dinner???? they took off $1.99. Bitched and they took off another 10%. Still NOT WORTH IT!!!. And all they said was sorry but it's our policy. Yes go ahead and laugh..... we are Seniors and eat in a lot of diners.  Never experienced anything like this before. RANT OVER. \n",

After sampling 7 different items on the menu I can see why. In a nutshell... The food is terrible. The pulled pork sandwich was dry as the Sahara. Potato wedges were bland, tasteless and soggy.  Not to mention the larger ones were undercooked.  The mashed potatoes were like trying to eat a container of white playdoh. How about the fries?  Listen... if you can't make French fries crispy then stop making them. Maybe salt on them would help but probably not. The Mac and cheese had zero flavor and the texture made me think it was microwaved Mac and cheese from the dollar store sitting on your countertop for a few hours. The fried chicken breading flavor wasn't terrible but it was wet and soggy. That's a no no. It's fried chicken for Gods sake. CRISPY please!  Lastly the  biscuits... What can I say? Dry and tasteless. Did I say dry? I did. Big disappointment. One star is too much for this joint. I give the place 6 months. \n",

Also, for anyone deducting stars due to wait times, wouldn't you rather your food be cooked to order than sitting on some cart all day?
